# blog.pierrehenry.be

Minimal Hugo site for blog.pierrehenry.be, using the fantastic clean and [minimalist](https://medium.com/pierrewriter/%EF%B8%8Fim-a-minimalist-for-years-why-i-m-freaking-love-it-2f9f8ac8041) [hugo-bearblog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) theme.

## What This Repo Contains

This site publishes Pierre-Henry Soria's English articles with an emphasis on:

- Tech and software engineering
- Digital nomad work and travel
- Money and wealth
- Time management, tasks, productivity, and time blocking
- Entrepreneurship

The content import is automated from the source markdown archive at `~/Code/youtube-to-medium-blog-posts-automation/articles`.

## Local Development

Install Hugo first:

```bash
brew install hugo
```

Import the English articles into the Hugo content folder:

```bash
python3 scripts/import_articles.py --clean
```

Run the site locally:

```bash
hugo server
```

Build the production site:

```bash
hugo build
```

## Content Rules

The importer keeps only English-ready markdown files with structured metadata, normalizes their Hugo front matter, removes duplicated opening headings, strips leftover promotional clutter, and promotes the target niches on the homepage via priority tags.
